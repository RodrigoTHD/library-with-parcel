# Parcel Library Boilerplate

## Parcel TypeScript

[Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) also supports building libraries written in TypeScript. The source field can point to your entry .ts or .tsx file, and Parcel will output JavaScript into your targets automatically. You can also use the types field in package.json to point to a .d.ts file, and Parcel will generate a typings file alongside the compiled JavaScript. This lets editors like VSCode provide autocomplete for users of your library.
